For women, 14–20% is Athletic, 21–24% Fit, 25–31% Average, and 32% or more Overweight. Maintaining a healthy body fat percentage improves energy, metabolism, and overall well-being.

Eating fewer calories (e.g., 1,700) creates a calorie deficit and leads to weight loss, while eating more (e.g., 2,700) creates a surplus and leads to weight gain. Remember, 1 pound of fat is roughly equal to 3,500 calories, so a daily deficit of 500 calories can help you lose about 1 pound per week.

For example, if your BMR is 1600 calories and your activity multiplier is 1.55 (moderate exercise), your TDEE = 1600 × 1.55 = 2480 calories per day. Interpretation: To maintain your current weight, eat around 2480 calories daily. To lose weight, consume fewer calories than your TDEE; to gain weight, eat more.

      resultExplain: "You started with $10,000 as your initial savings and added $200 every month for 10 years. With an annual interest rate of 5%, your money grows thanks to compound interest, which means you earn interest on both your original savings and the interest already added over time. This makes your total savings reach about $47,526, which includes your contributions ($34,000) and the interest earned ($13,526). However, inflation reduces the real value of money over time. For example, if inflation is 3% per year, $1 today will only buy the equivalent of about $0.74 in 10 years. After accounting for inflation, your savings are worth around $35,364 in today’s dollars. Taxes also reduce your gains. Assuming a 10% tax on the interest earned, the government takes a portion of your profit, leaving you with around $46,374 after tax. You set a goal of $50,000. Because of inflation and taxes, your net savings fall slightly short of this goal, missing by about $2,473. This shows why it’s important to consider both inflation and taxes when planning for long-term financial goals.",

        {
          q: "What is fielding percentage in baseball?",
          a: "Fielding percentage is a defensive statistic that shows how often a player successfully handles the ball. It compares successful plays to total chances, which include putouts, assists, and errors. A higher percentage means fewer mistakes in the field."
        },
        {
          q: "What does a good fielding percentage indicate?",
          a: "A good fielding percentage usually shows reliability. It means the player converts most defensive chances into outs. Coaches often use it to judge consistency, especially for infielders and catchers."
        },
        {
          q: "Are errors the only negative factor in fielding percentage?",
          a: "Yes, errors are the main factor that lowers fielding percentage. Each error increases total chances without increasing successful plays, which reduces the final value. That is why clean handling is important in defensive play."
        },
        {
          q: "Does fielding percentage measure defensive range?",
          a: "No, fielding percentage does not measure how much ground a player covers. It only measures how well a player handles balls they reach. Range and reaction speed require different defensive metrics."
        },
        {
          q: "Can fielding percentage vary by position?",
          a: "Yes, fielding percentage often varies by position. First basemen and catchers usually have higher percentages because of frequent routine plays. Outfielders may have fewer chances but face different defensive situations."
        },
        {
          q: "Is fielding percentage enough to judge defensive performance?",
          a: "Fielding percentage is helpful but not complete. It shows handling ability but not overall defensive impact. Analysts often combine it with other defensive statistics for a fuller view of player performance."

      whatContent1: "A Slugging Percentage Calculator helps measure a baseball player’s power at the plate. Slugging percentage shows how many total bases a player earns per at-bat. Unlike basic averages, it gives more weight to extra-base hits, which makes it useful for evaluating power hitting.",
      whatContent2: "This calculator supports clear player analysis by turning raw hitting data into a single number. Coaches, analysts, and fans use it to understand how effective a hitter is at producing runs through strong contact.",


      understandingtitle: "Understanding Slugging Percentage in Baseball",
      understandingpara1: "Slugging percentage focuses on total bases and at-bats. Each hit type has a different value. Singles, doubles, triples, and home runs all count, but extra-base hits increase the total more. This shows how much damage a hitter does when they make contact.",
      understandingpara2: "Because it reflects hit quality, slugging percentage is a core part of offensive statistics. It helps explain why two players with the same batting average can have very different impacts on a game.",

      howtitle: "How the Slugging Percentage Calculator Works",
      howpara1: "The calculator uses official baseball scoring rules. You enter how many singles, doubles, triples, and home runs a player has, along with total at-bats. The tool then calculates total bases and divides them by at-bats to produce the slugging percentage.",
